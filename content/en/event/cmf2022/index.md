Georgian and Swiss colleagues join to have thematic common session "Protected areas and sustainable mountain development- park-people interaction under PA expansion and tourism crisis" at the  [the third Caucasus Mountain Forum (CMF3)](https://www.caucasus-mt.net/Caucasus-Mountain-Forum-2021/cmf-objectives.html-1).

The recent increase of PAs in mountain regions and elsewhere, the expansion of their goals beyond nature conservation, and a general push to more inclusive and participatory planning procedures have led to a proliferation of PA discourses, disputes, and societal impacts. By introducing new concepts and rules, the PA establishes a new reality in the area (Paige, Igoe, Brocking-ton, 2006). Community participation and the transition from traditional livelihoods to new alternatives are emerging in tandem with growing PA development activities. Issues of trust between the PA administration and stakeholders, particularly residents who live near PAs, are crucial in this process. On the other hand, PAs play an integral role in tourism development, creating vital economic prospects for local residents in alternative/new livelihood activities. Significantly, in most mountain regions worldwide, locals have limited possibilities to generate income; therefore, delivering mountain-protected areas as sustainable tourism destinations are seen as a source of employment and additional economic benefits. The Covid19 pandemic severely impacted the tourism industry, in fact creating opportunities for alternative tourism sub-sectors such as ecotourism. PAs are promoted to attain sustainable mountain development by supporting local production, expanding marketing, and increasing destination competitiveness, in addition to tourism growth. In this session, we seek to discuss the socio-economic and political processes linked to protected areas (PAs)  in the Caucasus and other mountainous areas, as well as their implications for sustainable mountain development. 

The thematic foci of the session are (among others):

- Impacts on local tourism development;
- Impact of Covid-19 pandemic on PA tourism;
- Impacts on the local population;
- Conflicts surrounding PA establishment;
- Trust-building in participatory processes;
- Lessons learned of PA projects;
- Discourses and imaginations influencing PA establishment and management.
