I am a Fellow at the [Center for Eastern European Studies](https://www.cees.uzh.ch/en/ueberuns.html) and an Assistant Professor at the [International Black Sea University](https://ibsu.edu.ge/en/law-page/about-school/).

With years of experience in research and consulting, I specialize in agriculture, tourism, and rural development for international, public, and academic sectors.

I'm passionate about applying mixed-methods approaches and collaborating across disciplines and sectors to produce real-world solutions. I believe that research is only meaningful if it leads to tangible action and transformative change. That's why I advocate for participatory methods that engage communities and stakeholders in the research process, so that our findings don't end up collecting dust on shelves or in databases.
