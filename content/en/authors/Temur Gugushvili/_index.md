I am affiliated with [International Black Sea University](https://ibsu.edu.ge/en/law-page/about-school/) as Assistant Professor and working with international and local organizations by consulting in the field of my propositional expertise. With a rich background in research and consulting, I specialize in agriculture, tourism, and rural development across international, public, and academic sectors.

I'm passionate about applying mixed-methods approaches and collaborating across disciplines and sectors to produce real-world solutions. I believe that research is only meaningful if it leads to tangible action and transformative change. That's why I advocate for participatory methods that engage communities and stakeholders in the research process, so that our findings don't end up collecting dust on shelves or in databases.
