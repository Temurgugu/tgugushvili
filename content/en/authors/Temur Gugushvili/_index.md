Currently, I am working at the [Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Representation in Georgia](https://www.fao.org/georgia/en/) as Researcher. At the same time, I am a PhD Candidate at Tbilisi State University, Department of Sociology. My academic career already includes several impactful research [projects](https://temurgugushvili.ge/project/) focusing on rural and mountain development.

As researching international, public and academic sectors, I see the advantages and disadvantages of both qualitative and quantitative research methods. That is why, in some cases, the only solution to capture the whole perspective is to craft a mixed-methods research design.

After accumulating research experiences in interdisciplinary, transdisciplinary, participatory, action and transformative studies, I favour these approaches, which prevent staying the research results on the dusty shells or databases.

I believe that the researcher's primary role is to explore the hitherto hidden and spread it in an understandable way to the relevant stakeholders. For this reason, I synthesise in practice social science theories, methods and information handling tools, such as R/Rstudio, QGIS, SPSS, Excel, Access, MAXQDA, Mendeley, etc.
