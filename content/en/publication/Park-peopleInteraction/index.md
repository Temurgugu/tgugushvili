abstract: This paper traces the case of Kazbegi National Park expansion and seeks to explore factors that shape or prevent trust-building between the park representatives and stakeholders. The research employed a qualitative methodology, using participatory mapping within discussions to allow the interview partners to link spatial information with extension areas. Comprehensive geographical coverage and participantsâ€™ maximal variation ensured the representativeness of the data collected. Overall, the article reviews various case studies and summarizes the similarities and differences in building trust during the expansion of protected areas in the Caucasus and other regions.
