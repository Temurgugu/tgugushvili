abstract: The use of the case study method in teaching has a long history and is considered one of the unique tools for bridging the gap between theory and practice.  Case studies are important to help students establish a direct relation between societal issues and theoretical knowledge. Furthermore, Daneri, Trencher and Peterson (2015) argue that student-centered case studies could play an essential role in addressing problems of participating local communities.
