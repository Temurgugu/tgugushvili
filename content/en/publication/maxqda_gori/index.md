abstract: The 21st Century era has raised unique challenges for urban settlements and the development of many cities around the world still hinges on outdated urban planning approaches. Urban planning is often hindered by poor planning trends, which serve as the utmost barriers to development and divorce global goals from true localization. Despite the fact that many international policy documents such as the Sustainable Development Goals (Goal 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities), New Urban Agenda (Habitat III), EU/Georgia Association Agreement, etc., outlined guidelines for inclusive and sustainable development, the real obstacle of how to execute global or national objects on the local level remains.
